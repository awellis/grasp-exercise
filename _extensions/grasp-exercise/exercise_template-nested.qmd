# Exercise Title

Brief introduction to the exercise topic and learning objectives.

::: {.checkpoint number="1" image="static/checkpoint1_summary.png"}

### Checkpoint 1: Main Learning Objective Title

::: {.main-question}
Pose the primary question or challenge for this checkpoint. This should be something students can answer after completing all the steps within this checkpoint.

Example: "Based on the data visualization above, what can you conclude about the relationship between variables X and Y?"
:::

::: {.main-answer}
Provide a comprehensive answer to the main question. This should synthesize the learning from all steps in the checkpoint.

**Key points:**
- Point 1 with explanation
- Point 2 with reasoning
- Point 3 with implications

**Conclusion:** Summarize the main insight or learning outcome.
:::

  ::: {.step number="1" image="static/step1_1.png"}
  
  ::: {.guiding-question}
  What fundamental concept should students understand first?
  :::
  
  ::: {.guiding-answer}
  Explain the fundamental concept clearly and concisely. Connect it to prior knowledge and preview how it relates to the overall checkpoint objective.
  
  **Key takeaway:** One-sentence summary of this step's learning.
  :::
  
  :::
  
  ::: {.step number="2" image="static/step1_2.png"}
  
  ::: {.guiding-question}
  How does this concept apply in practice?
  :::
  
  ::: {.guiding-answer}
  Provide practical examples or applications. Show step-by-step reasoning or calculation if appropriate.
  
  **Example:**
  - Demonstrate with concrete data
  - Show the process
  - Highlight common pitfalls
  :::
  
  :::
  
  ::: {.step number="3" image="static/step1_3.png"}
  
  ::: {.guiding-question}
  What are the assumptions or limitations to consider?
  :::
  
  ::: {.guiding-answer}
  Discuss important assumptions, limitations, or conditions that affect the application of this concept.
  
  **Important considerations:**
  1. Assumption/limitation 1
  2. Assumption/limitation 2  
  3. When this approach works best

::: {.checkpoint number="2" image="static/checkpoint2_summary.png"}

### Checkpoint 2: Advanced Application

::: {.main-question}
Present a more complex scenario that builds on Checkpoint 1. This should require students to integrate and apply their learning.

Example: "Now that you understand the basic concept, how would you handle this more complex situation where [describe scenario]?"
:::

::: {.main-answer}
Provide a thorough analysis of the complex scenario. Show how the concepts from Checkpoint 1 are applied in this new context.

**Analysis:**
- Break down the problem components
- Apply learned concepts systematically  
- Consider multiple perspectives or approaches

**Implications:** Discuss broader implications or connections to real-world applications.
:::

  ::: {.step number="1" image="static/step2_1.png"}
  
  ::: {.guiding-question}
  How do you adapt the basic approach for this new scenario?
  :::
  
  ::: {.guiding-answer}
  Guide students through the adaptation process. Show what changes and what stays the same.
  
  **Adaptation steps:**
  1. Identify what's different
  2. Modify the approach accordingly
  3. Validate the adapted solution
  :::
  
  :::
  
  ::: {.step number="2" image="static/step2_2.png"}
  
  ::: {.guiding-question}
  What additional considerations arise in complex scenarios?
  :::
  
  ::: {.guiding-answer}
  Discuss advanced considerations, trade-offs, or optimization strategies that become relevant in complex applications.
  
  **Advanced considerations:**
  - Factor 1 and its impact
  - Factor 2 and how to address it
  - Best practices for complex cases

### What You've Learned
- Main concept from Checkpoint 1
- Advanced application from Checkpoint 2
- Integration of concepts

### Next Steps
Suggest how students can continue their learning or apply these concepts in their work.

## Template Guidelines

### Writing Effective Questions
- **Main Questions**: Should be answerable after completing all steps in a checkpoint
- **Guiding Questions**: Should build toward understanding the main question
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Start simple, build complexity gradually

### Structuring Answers
- **Concise but Complete**: Provide enough detail without overwhelming
- **Use Formatting**: Bold key points, use bullets for clarity
- **Include Examples**: Concrete examples help solidify understanding

### Image Integration
- **Relevant Visuals**: Include images that directly support the learning
- **Consistent Naming**: Use clear, systematic naming for image files
- **Accessible Alt Text**: Ensure images enhance rather than rely on visual-only information

### Content Organization
1. **One Concept per Step**: Each step should focus on a single learning point
2. **Logical Progression**: Steps should build naturally toward the checkpoint goal
3. **Clear Hierarchy**: Use the nested structure to show relationships between concepts
